# Spain's-energy-shortfall-crisis

### Introduction
Predicting energy shortfalls is crucial for sustainable infrastructure planning, and our mission is to support the Government of Spain in optimizing its electricity systems. This report outlines our approach, methodologies, and findings in developing a predictive model for electricity shortfalls in Spain.

### Project Goals
Our primary goal is to streamline processes, from database design to setting up analytic dashboards, fostering confident collaboration with our team of biometrics experts.

### Problem Statement
The Government of Spain has commissioned our company to build a model predicting shortfalls between energy generated by fossil fuels and renewable sources. As Spain contemplates expanding its renewable energy infrastructure, insights into trends and patterns are essential for effective planning.

Renewable energy's variability and slow deployment necessitate accurate predictions to prevent power outages or unnecessary resource expenditure. Our model aims to provide Spain with a tool to forecast electricity needs confidently.

### EDA and Feature Engineering
#### Data Exploration
Load shortfall, defined as fossil fuel-generated power minus renewable production, serves as our key metric. Various factors impacting electricity demand and supply were considered, including time, weather conditions, and city-specific variables.
#### Insights from EDA

High correlation between several variables, posing multicollinearity concerns.

Presence of outliers and notable patterns, such as lower power consumption on weekends and higher load shortfalls in summer.

#### Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Removed unnecessary columns and redundant features.
- Created new features by splitting the "time" feature into month, day of the week, year, and hour components.
- Performed standard scaling for consistent machine learning interpretation.

### Model Evaluation
We built and evaluated 12 regression models, including linear regression, random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Thorough assessments using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared guided the selection of the best-performing models.

#### Ensemble Creation
Four ensembles were formed, three averaging model predictions and one weighting models based on performance. The ensemble of kernel ridge and random forest models emerged as the top performer.

### Business Value/Conclusion
Accurate predictions empower policymakers, utility companies, and grid operators to make informed decisions. Our model facilitates policy formulation, efficient resource planning, demand response initiatives, and real-time energy balancing.

### Key Business Values
- Improved electricity demand and supply forecasting.
- Optimal resource allocation and enhanced grid stability.
- Proactive decision-making and significant cost savings.
- Contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices.

### Future Prospects
- Our model already outperforms competitors and can be further enhanced with continuous refinement. Our team's passion and dedication make collaboration both pleasant and profitable. - - - Choosing to work with our company enables Spain to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and address challenges posed by electricity shortfalls and the climate crisis.

Thank you.
